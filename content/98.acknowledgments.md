## Acknowledgments

The authors of this paper would like to extend their deepest gratitude to the many, many individual and institutions that have contributed, directly or indirectly, to the growth of both `yt` and the `yt` community.

We particularly thank KIPAC and SLAC at Stanford, the University of California at San Diego and Santa Cruz, the High-Performance Astro Computing Center, Columbia University, the University of Illinois, University of Colorado at Boulder, University of Edinburgh, the scientific Python community, NumFOCUS, 

MT dedicates this paper to the memory of Michael S. Warren, who was both friend and mentor to several of us on the development team.
Mike passed away during the final stages of its completion, but his influence was felt deeply along the way.
Mike was a truly inspirational person, and provided deep mentorship and guidance to multiple of the authors of this paper -- and stepped in with encouragement, advice and friendship at two specific, critical junctures in the development history of yt.
Thank you, Mike, and we miss you.
Tomorrow, we're gonna do Stonehenge.
